# APCS
- Collection of my older high school projects
- These are older programs I wrote in high school while doing an independent study in computer science with my previous AP computer science 'A' teacher.
- These notably vary in quality, and I'm keeping this public as an archive of what I've done in the past in my free time, since most of my more recent work is in class assignments that are far less interesting.
