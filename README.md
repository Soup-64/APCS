# APCS
Collection of my apcs projects
Please note that lan chat is zipped up as github was having trouble uploading the entire project, and also keep in mind that some of these programs are here for archival purposes and may not have the cleanest code, and are likely not production ready.
Also note that I am using linux at this time and I am therefore unable to test if the music player program still compiles as intended as it is the only program that is entirely windows-only here.
